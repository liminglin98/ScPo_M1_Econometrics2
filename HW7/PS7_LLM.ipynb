    "## Problem 1\n",
    "On the Fulton fish market about 35 different wholesale dealers sell fish to the customers that visit the market from Monday to Friday. There are no posted prices and dealers can (and do) charge different prices to different consumers. In this exercise you will analyze data which were recovered from a single dealer on the Fulton fish market. The data run from December 2nd, 1991 through May 8th, 1992 and record daily transactions in whiting. Whiting is a cheap fish which is oily and distinctive tasting. Whiting vary relatively little in size and quality, and there is probably little scope for substitution with other types of fish. Use fulton.dta. The dataset contains the quantity of whiting sold in pounds (qty) and the average (quantity weighted) prices in dollars per pound (price), information about the day of the week (Monday-Friday) and the weather conditions (stormy, mixed)"
