# ScPo_M1_Econometrics2
This repository contains the source code of my submitted version of homework for Econometrics2. \\
I mainly used Jupyter Notebook to write the answers. In terms of programming languages, I primarily use Stata and R, but I am also learning Julia now.\\
I usually doubled-check my answers with other students, but they are not necessarily correct. Still, I hope my answers might be helpful.\\
